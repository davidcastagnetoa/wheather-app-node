# Task Manager Application

The Node console application utilizes an API to retrieve weather data for a user-specified city. It makes HTTP requests to the API endpoint, fetches the response, and extracts relevant weather information such as temperature, conditions, and humidity. The retrieved data is then formatted and displayed in the console for the user. The application leverages Node's asynchronous nature to handle the API calls efficiently, ensuring fast and responsive weather updates. With its streamlined design and seamless integration of API data, this Node console application provides a robust solution for users to access and monitor real-time weather information with ease.

The application is based on Fernando Herrera's Node course on Udemy.
